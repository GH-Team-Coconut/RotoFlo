## Introduction 

RotoFlo is a motion interactive AR experience. Our app leverages machine learning to generate dynamic, algorithmic full body filters, allowing users to save and share stunning and expressive video content.

## Visit the Deployed App

[RotoFlo](https://rotoflo.herokuapp.com/) 
RotoFlo can be used in-browser on a laptop or desktop. Please see 'Using RotoFlo' for further insight on use when creating, and saving videos. 

#### Using RotoFlo 

Becoming a user of RotoFlo is quick and easy. Upon clicking the link above you will be directed to the landing page. 

1. Create an account to engage with the site and its features
2. Once logged in, choose from a drop down menu of filter options and toggle   between “webcam on” if you would like to be in the final video or “webcam off” if you just want your illustration to render
3. Press the play button to record. You’ll be shown a 5 second countdown to get in place
4. You have 10 seconds to ‘bust a move’ or you can stop recording earlier
5. A prompt will appear on the screen asking you to input a project title: choose to save or trash your project
6. View your projects in the Gallery  
7. To download or delete video, click on the specific video to go to the single page view

## Tech Stack
 RotoFlo utilized a wide variety of technologies to help actualize our vision. The most prevalent of these being TenserFlow.js, ReactWebcam and html5Canvas. 

- TenserFlow: TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

- The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap. HTML5 Canvas also helps in making 2D games.

- React Webcam is a library that provides a React compatible webcam componet. Alongside MediaRecorderAPI, React Wecam allows you to instantiate and record an active stream. 

## Working With Our Codebase

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. `npm install`.
3. Create `Rotoflo` database.
4. Seed the database with `npm run seed`.
5. Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start:dev`.
6. Navigate to `localhost:8080` to see FormFit in action!

## The Future Of RotoFlo

We are very proud of what we have accomplished so far with RotoFlo, and are very excited to continue building out features and optimizing our web application. Some of these developments we plan to implement include releasing our  app as an open source platform for other programmers to create more filter offerings. Alongside the option to include the user’s webcam as a background, we’d like for users to have a choice of additional backgrounds, and the ability to upload directly to social media. Finally we’d like to see our app come to life with an experience mode, where users have the option to create a live interactive installation with a projector in shared space.

## Special Thanks

We’d like to give a special thanks to Joe Alves, our lead Instructor, and Josephine Wang our mentor and Project Manager. Thank Jason Mayes, and Sam Hannan who very graciously consulted with us on our use of TenserFlow. We’d also like to thank our friends in the industry, Morgan Pierson, Bryan Clark, Eugene Chung, and Deanna Dune for help with debugging and moral support. We deeply appreciate you all, thank you so much!
